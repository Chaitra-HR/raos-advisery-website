## Hello, I'm Chaitra 

In today's world where everything from cars to coffee mugs are available in abundance, consumers don't just look for function anymore - they're seeking out objects or businesses who stand apart by having some sort of personal meaning behind them like their favorite sports team logo or passion. 

Ever since the age of antiquity, humans have sought to create things that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. In our current society, there is a trend for people and companies alike to want products with personality; something they can connect with on an emotional level. I believe in this philosophy wholeheartedly and design every project I release full of brand personality so as your prospects surf through online looking for "the perfect adviser," make sure “you’re the one”!

So you know if you work with me are full of personality, connecting with people on an emotional level.

I push boundaries
